  <h1>About Street Support</h1>
  <p>Street Support Network connects people and organisations locally to End Homelessness together.</p>
  <p>Our long term vision is a citizen-led network, where people with personal insight into homelessness, decision
    makers and people with resources co-create solutions together.</p>
  <p>We have a core team of 5 people based in Manchester, 2 of us have lived experience of homelessness. Each location
    we are active in has a local co-ordinator, supported by organisations and volunteers.</p>
  <p>You can find out more in the News section of our website, or on Facebook, or Twitter.</p>
