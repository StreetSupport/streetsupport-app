  <h1>About Street Support</h1>
  <p>Street Support is a network that connects charities and voluntary groups that support homeless people, with all those whoâ€™d like to help.</p>
  <p>We are a collective of digital experts based in Manchester UK, working closely alongside local people who are homeless and the organisations that support them.</p>
  <p>We launched in Manchester in early 2016, with Leeds coming online soon, and we hope to reach out to more locations in the coming months. If you would like to see Street Support in your city, get in touch!</p>
  <p>You can find out more in the News section of our website, or on Facebook, or Twitter.</p>
